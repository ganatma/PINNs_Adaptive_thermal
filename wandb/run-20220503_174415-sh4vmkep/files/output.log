C:\Users\ganat\Anaconda3\envs\tf24\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\keras\optimizer_v2\optimizer_v2.py:375: UserWarning: The `lr` argument is deprecated, use `learning_rate` instead.

  0/500 [..............................] - ETA: 0sWARNING:tensorflow:Calling GradientTape.gradient on a persistent tape inside its context is significantly less efficient than calling it outside the context (it causes the gradient ops to be recorded on the tape, leading to increased CPU and memory usage). Only call GradientTape.gradient inside the context if you actually want to trace the gradient in order to compute higher order derivatives.



  4/500 [..............................] - ETA: 45:31WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function grad at 0x000002BE5295F798> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.
